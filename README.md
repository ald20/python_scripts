# python_scripts
Python scripts written by AD for creating inputs/analysis of shape modelling software
These are really just a backup for files on my local machine...

dist_corr_app_mags - Reads in individual lightcurve files, distance corrects magnitudes using astroquery.jplhorizons
period_range_script - Generates input files for convexinv period_scan (Kaasalainen & Torppa 2001, Kaasalainen et al. 2001, Durech et al. 2010)
plot_chi_sq - For use following completed period_scan and concanate: Use to obtain sideral period with min chi-sq.
lc_shifts - For use after convexinv & matlab procedures: Reads Matlab output shifts form artificial lcs, plots phase function.
